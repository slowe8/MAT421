        "Being able to determine the roots, or zeros or solutions, of a function is a very valuable skill. In school, we find roots to basic functions using various mathematical methods, however, for complex functions, this process can be very difficult. Instead of finding these roots by hand, we turn to computers to approximate the roots of arbitrary funcitons for us. Using the same numerical methods we could use by hand, we can write a program that approximates the roots of a program by crawling along the function to determine where the root is. In python, the basic function fsolve from the scipy library is used to find the roots of a function."

However, if we are iterating through the process and we get multiple answers that are all within a small error, then we should expect that the last calculation we get is acceptable as the solution. This small window of error is called a tolerance. <br> There is a caviot to using tolerance in a method like this. For example, the function f(x) = x^2 + tol has no real roots, however x = tol/2 is an acceptable solution to the method becuase it is within the tolerance of the algorithm. Situations like this should be avoided because it produces wrong solutions.\n",

A basic explaination of it is that if there are two points on a smooth, continuous function, then there is guaranteed to be a point between them. By starting with a point above and below zero, the bisection method estimates roots by moving closer to 0 over each iteration."
